# hello-world
I am reading other cipher development records to learn about best practice standards to achieve maximum results.
My goal by the end of this semester is to learn how to obfuscate my own string objects using php trap doors. My primary focus in server side scripting is to ensure information in any database the client is accessing should be secured.
